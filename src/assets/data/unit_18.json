  "information": [
    {
      "title": "Definition",
      "description": "The Basic Structure Doctrine is a judicial principle that the Constitution of India has certain basic features that cannot be altered or destroyed through amendments by the parliament. It was evolved by the Supreme Court of India in the landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Origin",
      "description": "The doctrine emerged as a response to the government's attempts to amend the Constitution in ways that could potentially undermine its core principles. It was first outlined in the Kesavananda Bharati case, where a 13-judge bench ruled by a 7-6 majority."
    },
    {
      "title": "Key Features",
      "description": "While the Supreme Court has not provided an exhaustive list, some of the basic features identified include: supremacy of the Constitution, republican and democratic form of government, secular character of the Constitution, separation of powers, and federalism."
    },
    {
      "title": "Significance",
      "description": "The doctrine acts as a check on the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution. It ensures that the fundamental nature of the Indian Constitution cannot be altered to fit the whims of a particular government or a temporary majority."
    },
    {
      "title": "Application",
      "description": "The doctrine has been applied in several subsequent cases. For instance, in the Minerva Mills case (1980), the Supreme Court used this doctrine to strike down clauses of the 42nd Amendment which had given the Parliament unlimited power to amend the Constitution."
    },
    {
      "title": "Criticism",
      "description": "The doctrine has been criticized by some as being undemocratic, arguing that it gives too much power to unelected judges to determine what constitutes the 'basic structure'. However, supporters argue it's necessary to protect the essence of the Constitution."
